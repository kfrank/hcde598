For the first assignment, I decided to build a stand for a nametag I received while attending [Greenville Grok](https://greenvillegrok.com/), an unconference for people who create things online. I attended this conference on April 5th & 6th and had to fly across the country to Greenville, SC. This limited the time I was able to spend actually making something and also limited the tools and materials available to me.

The nametags were on 5 1‚ÅÑ4-inch floppy disks, which made me recall the history presented to us in our first class. Like all the inventions that led us to modern fabrication with digital tools, our modern internet technologies have evolved from the storage popular in the 70s and early 80s. Some of those early digital fabrication files were probably saved on a floppy just like this. Moving forward, I think it's important to recognize the achievements of the past, what we can learn from their discoveries, and what we still have yet to learn while building new things.
