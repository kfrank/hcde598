# House Plant & Planter Construction Kit

Want to get in on the house plant trend but kill even a snake plant? Why not laser cut one? Guaranteed never to die since it’s made out of cardboard. You’ll never run the risk of forgetting to water it!

_(Just don’t water it. Cardboard is not a living thing and doesn’t need water for nutrients.)_

## Designing the planter

I wanted a planter shape that turned 2D cardboard into a 3D cylindrical shape since it's more of a challenge than changing 2D objects, like cardboard, into a cube with 90° angles. To start, I browsed planters on CB2 for inspiration. At first, I thought about creating a grid with angled notches to fit squares into a cylinder, like in the below image. This _may_ have worked, but seemed like it would be tricky to make solid and would've required a lot of angle calculations and physical testing. Cool concept, but not feasible for me given the time frame for this project.

Instead, I turned to thinking about using vertical pieces taking a cross-section of the radius of a planter. By placing these on an angle these pieces could visually cover the shape of a planter, retain the integrity of a cylindrical planter shape, and not require lots of intricate connects thus making the structure much more solid. I designed the planter with twelve pieces to fit on 30° intervals around planter circumference.

To fit the vertical cross-section pieces together, I designed the planter with two circles 7" wide in diameter to place at the top and bottom of the vertical pieces. These act as the top and bottom of the planter.

To achieve a more solid-looking visual effect, I aligned two notches which were 1/2 inch deep and 0.17 wide (to match the thickness of the cardboard I used) to the top and bottom of the circle. I then rotated these notches 340° and aligned the outward corner of the notch closest to the circle with the edge of the circle. I repeated this step for the remaining 10 notches, placed 30° apart to match the 12 vertical pieces.

I then wanted to make sure that all the pieces were aligned on a z-axis in anticipation of these circular pieces not being completely level by user construction only. I added 1/2 inch deep by 0.17 wide notches to the top and bottom of the vertical planter-profile pieces to align with the notches on the top and bottom circular pieces. When these two notches get locked in place together, the circular pieces should stay level.

## Building the plant

To create something nice to sit in the planter, I turned to snake plants. These are tall and the visual effect of their leaves can roughly be achieved in a 2D plane, which is why they were chosen. I created 10 different leaf varieties to mimic the shape of snake plant leaves and increased the height of the leaves incrementally by a 1/2 inch for each leaf from 2" all the way up to 8".

I then added a long "popsicle stick" at the bottom of the leaf to act as a root through the top circle and through the pot. To stabilize this further, I added a third circle and adjusted the vertical pieces to add an additional identical notch 2" below the top notch. This gives each of the leaf "roots" something to sit in like a nice bed of dirt.

I then choose one circle to act as the top of the plant and drew rectangular cut-outs in a spiral pattern to mimic natural plant growth. These were by .625" by .17" wide (the magic cardboard thickness number). These will be where the popsicle sticks part of the leaves will drop into the planter.

## Laser cutting everything

I assembled four artboards sized to cardboard I had pre-sized from a large Lego box and laid out each object to fit. I set the laser cutter to 25% power 100% speed and each object to a stroke width of .001pt. This worked well enough to properly cut out everything, though there was some funky smelling carboard smoke (which you can see in the gifs).

I ran into an issue where the vertical pieces, even though the stroke was set to the smallest setting, still wanted to be raster cut by the laser cutter instead of vector cut. I had to re-draw this shape using one of the leaves I knew had already laser cut as vector.

## Modifications

I originally designed each vertical piece with only one notch and removed every third notch from the circular pieces to fit the two together (which you can see in the laser cutting gifs). While this worked to solidly piece the two types of pieces together, it did not strictly adhere to the assignment criteria. Instead, I went back and editing all the vertical pieces to have all three notches, this time half as wide and also edited the circles to have notches half as wide at every 30°. This technique still allows a solid connection between the two types while adhering to the criteria of having 12 instances of one unique part (in this case, the 12 vertical planter-profile pieces). This is reflected in the [source illustrator file](http://klare.io/hcde598/documentation/laser-cut-kit/planter.ai).

## Assembling the final plant

To assemble the plant, first, put together the planter. Take one vertical profile piece and slide it into the slots on the three circles with the circle with rectangular cut-outs at the top. Do the same on the opposite side. Then, fill in with vertical pieces around all sides of the circles.

Choose your leaves. To achieve optimum plant growth, choose taller leaves for the center and smaller leaves on the outside. Place next to a real snake plant to keep it company.
