            <h2 id="designing-the-planter">Designing the planter</h2>

            <p>
              I wanted a planter shape that turned 2D cardboard into a 3D
              cylindrical shape since it's more of a challenge than changing 2D
              objects, like cardboard, into a cube with 90° angles. To start, I
              browsed planters on CB2 for inspiration. At first, I thought about
              creating a grid with angled notches to fit squares into a
              cylinder, like in the below image. This <em>may</em> have worked,
              but seemed like it would be tricky to make solid and would've
              required a lot of angle calculations and physical testing. Cool
              concept, but not feasible for me given the time frame for this
              project.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img
                src="/hcde598/images/assignment1/cb2-planter.png"
                alt="Two ombre planters with square design"
              />

            </p>

            <p>
              Instead, I turned to thinking about using vertical pieces taking a
              cross-section of the radius of a planter. By placing these on an
              angle these pieces could visually cover the shape of a planter,
              retain the integrity of a cylindrical planter shape, and not
              require lots of intricate connects thus making the structure much
              more solid. I designed the planter with twelve pieces to fit on
              30° intervals around planter circumference.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img
                src="/hcde598/images/assignment1/laser-1.jpg"
                alt="Vertical cross-section pieces"
              />
            </p>

            <p>
              To fit the vertical cross-section pieces together, I designed the
              planter with two circles 7" wide in diameter to place at the top
              and bottom of the vertical pieces. These act as the top and bottom
              of the planter.
            </p>

            <p>
              To achieve a more solid-looking visual effect, I aligned two
              notches which were 1/2 inch deep and 0.17 wide (to match the
              thickness of the cardboard I used) to the top and bottom of the
              circle. I then rotated these notches 340° and aligned the outward
              corner of the notch closest to the circle with the edge of the
              circle. I repeated this step for the remaining 10 notches, placed
              30° apart to match the 12 vertical pieces.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img
                src="/hcde598/images/assignment1/laser-4.gif"

              />
              <em>Videos and gifs at 4x speed</em>
            </p>

            <p>
              I then wanted to make sure that all the pieces were aligned on a
              z-axis in anticipation of these circular pieces not being
              completely level by user construction only. I added 1/2 inch deep
              by 0.17 wide notches to the top and bottom of the vertical
              planter-profile pieces to align with the notches on the top and
              bottom circular pieces. When these two notches get locked in place
              together, the circular pieces should stay level.
            </p>

            <h2 id="building-the-plant">Building the plant</h2>

            <p>
              To create something nice to sit in the planter, I turned to snake
              plants. These are tall and the visual effect of their leaves can
              roughly be achieved in a 2D plane, which is why they were chosen.
              I created 10 different leaf varieties to mimic the shape of snake
              plant leaves and increased the height of the leaves incrementally
              by a 1/2 inch for each leaf from 2" all the way up to 8".
            </p>

            <p>
              I then added a long "popsicle stick" at the bottom of the leaf to
              act as a root through the top circle and through the pot. To
              stabilize this further, I added a third circle and adjusted the
              vertical pieces to add an additional identical notch 2" below the
              top notch. This gives each of the leaf "roots" something to sit in
              like a nice bed of dirt.
            </p>

              />
            </p>

            <p>
              I then choose one circle to act as the top of the plant and drew
              rectangular cut-outs in a spiral pattern to mimic natural plant
              growth. These were by .625" by .17" wide (the magic cardboard
              thickness number). These will be where the popsicle sticks part of
              the leaves will drop into the planter.
            </p>

            <h2 id="laser-cutting-everything">Laser cutting everything</h2>

            <p>
              I assembled four artboards sized to cardboard I had pre-sized from
              a large Lego box and laid out each object to fit. I set the laser
              cutter to 25% power 100% speed and each object to a stroke width
              of .001pt. This worked well enough to properly cut out everything,
              though there was some funky smelling carboard smoke (which you can
              see in the gifs).
            </p>

              />
              <em>Cutting one of the artboards with the circular pieces</em>
            </p>

            <p>
              I ran into an issue where the vertical pieces, even though the
              stroke was set to the smallest setting, still wanted to be raster
              cut by the laser cutter instead of vector cut. I had to re-draw
              this shape using one of the leaves I knew had already laser cut as
              vector.

            </p>

            <h2 id="modifications">Modifications</h2>

            <p>
              I originally designed each vertical piece with only one notch and
              removed every third notch from the circular pieces to fit the two
              together (which you can see in the laser cutting gifs). While this
              worked to solidly piece the two types of pieces together, it did
              not strictly adhere to the assignment criteria. Instead, I went
              back and editing all the vertical pieces to have all three
              notches, this time half as wide and also edited the circles to
              have notches half as wide at every 30°. This technique still
              allows a solid connection between the two types while adhering to
              the criteria of having 12 instances of one unique part (in this
              case, the 12 vertical planter-profile pieces). This is reflected
              in the

            <p>
              To assemble the plant, first, put together the planter. Take one
              vertical profile piece and slide it into the slots on the three
              circles with the circle with rectangular cut-outs at the top. Do
              the same on the opposite side. Then, fill in with vertical pieces
              around all sides of the circles.
            </p>
